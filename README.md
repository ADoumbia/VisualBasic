# VisualBasic
Miscrosoft Visual Basic for Applications is a powerful tool within Excel that liberates the user from having to complete repetitive tasks. Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, is an object based language meaning that those familiar with OOP will be able to apply similar logic.

In this project, we look at complaint data from the City of Ottawa Municipal ByLaw. One of the issues present is that of the 25 wards in Ottawa, some complaints do not have a ward assigned to them. One may consider simply removing these values manually, but given that the spreadsheet has over 37,000 rows this may not be practical.

VBA frees the user from the contraints of large data volume to explore new alternatives. In this project, we chose to allocate unknown wards according to the proportion of the known wards.

There are many other ways to address the same problem but this solution allows us to explore the many functions of VBA. Finally, we take a look at User Defined Functions or UDFs which provides the user with even greater flexibility.
